The following text explains the contents of this folder and how to run the
different source files.

The folder 1_external_libraries contains the .h files for the parser,
interpreter and the library used to utilise the SDL graphics user interface.

The folder 2_source_code contains the source files for the parser and the
interpreter, along with their testing files, as well as the extension.

The folder 3_test_files contains .txt files that each has specific instructions
to test different cases for the parser, interpreter and extension.

The following programme uses clang instead of gcc. If the clang compiler is not
installed please use the following command:
sudo apt install clang

1. To compile the parser use the following command: make parse
   To run the parser: ./parse 3_test_files/filename.txt

2. To compile the testing file for the parser: make test_parser
   To run the testing file for the parser: ./test_parser

3. To compile the interpreter: make interp
   To run the interpreter: ./interp 3_test_files/filename.txt

4. To compile the testing file for the interpreter: make test_interpreter
   To run the testing file for the interpreter: ./test_interpreter

5. To compile the extension: make extension
   To run the extension: ./extension 3_test_files/filename.txt

6. To compile all five cases explained above: make all
   To run all five cases: make run

7. To remove the compiled files for all five cases: make clean
